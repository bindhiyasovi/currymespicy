This project is intended to complement my Wordpress Blog by providing a single page application built using AngularJS.
During the process I learned how to use Bootsrap, AngualarJS, Express/NodeJS.
Responsive design was one of my primary goals. 

Front End: 
    AngularJS - I learned how to use callback functions, leveraged existing direcives, used controllers to change the behavior per business logic.
    Bootstrap - I used grid system for responsive design, bootstrap container, menu and navigation bar.
Back End:
    Express/NodeJS - This was my first project using JavaScript backend. There is a lot to learn about NodeJS for me. So far I have learnt how to create various API end points.
    Created Express based routers to build out the required end points for this initial release.
    I plan to continue on adding more end points. 
    For ex : supporting query parameters for GET calls, creating new posts from this app.
